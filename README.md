# 🐍 Python Learning Journey with Projects

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository!  
This repo is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn Python step-by-step and build hands-on projects along the way.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains:

- ✅ Topic-wise learning folders with practice code  
- ✅ Beginner-friendly projects after each major topic  
- ✅ My personal notes, experiments, and code examples  
- ✅ A clear roadmap to keep myself accountable and motivated

I'm using this as a **learning log**, and I hope it helps others just starting out in Python too.
